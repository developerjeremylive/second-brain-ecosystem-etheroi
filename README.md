## What is a Second Brain?

A Second Brain is a personal knowledge management system that helps you capture, organize, and retrieve everything you learn, think, and create. Instead of relying on your memory, you offload information into a trusted external system.

The concept was popularized by [Tiago Forte](https://fortelabs.com/) and his **BASB** (Building a Second Brain) methodology, but you don't need to follow any specific framework to get started.

## What's in this ecosystem?

| Project | Description | Status |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| **[Landing Page](./index.html)** | Visual, bilingual landing page for the project — hosted on GitHub Pages | 🟢 Live |
| **[second-brain](./second-brain/)** | Step-by-step guide to set up your Second Brain from scratch using Obsidian — includes 7 bilingual guides, 7 starter templates, and an agent brief | 🟢 In progress |
| **[local-LLM](./local-LLM/)** | Optional guide to run a local model with Ollama for Librarian | 🟢 In progress |
| **[librarian](https://github.com/Agents4Life/librarian)** | Optional separate open-source review-driven knowledge maintenance pipeline for Obsidian vaults | 🟡 Experimental alpha |

## Quick Start

**Try the landing page first:** Open [index.html](./index.html) in your browser for a visual overview of the ecosystem, or visit the GitHub Pages deployment.

### Already have a Second Brain?

If you want AI assistance, try **[librarian](https://github.com/Agents4Life/librarian)** to add an optional agent layer to your vault.

## Templates

The ecosystem includes 7 starter Obsidian templates in [`second-brain/templates/`](./second-brain/templates/):

| Template | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `daily-template.md` | Daily note with focus, notes, ideas, and captured sections |
| `weekly-review.md` | Weekly review with inbox cleanup, project review, and planning |
| `source-template.md` | General source note with URL, author, and tags |
| `raw-source-template.md` | Source moved to `raw/` for Librarian processing |
| `wiki-concept-template.md` | Librarian concept page (wiki layer) |
| `wiki-source-template.md` | Librarian source index page (wiki layer) |
| `wiki-synthesis-template.md` | Librarian synthesis page (wiki layer) |

## Philosophy

- **Start simple** — You don't need 50 plugins on day one
- **Build habits first** — The system only works if you use it consistently
- **Iterate** — Your Second Brain evolves with you
- **Own your data** — Everything lives in plain Markdown files on your machine (when using local providers like Ollama, notes remain local; cloud providers may receive relevant note fragments depending on configuration)

## Who is this for?

- 🧑‍💻 Developers who want to organize their learning
- ✍️ Writers and content creators
- 📚 Students and lifelong learners
- 🏢 Professionals managing lots of information
- 🤖 Anyone curious about optional AI-assisted knowledge management

## Contributing

This project is in early stages. Contributions, suggestions, and translations are welcome!

## Current Reality

Librarian is currently:
- review-driven — all changes require human approval via CLI
- manually triggered — no automatic or background processes
- proposal-based — mutations go through a propose → review → approve → apply cycle
- experimental alpha software

## Future Direction

Planned capabilities include:
- incremental indexing
- filesystem watchers
- autonomous maintenance loops
- recovery and reconciliation systems

These are not implemented yet. Documentation describes current behavior unless explicitly marked as planned.
